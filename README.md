# Udacity-Programming-for-Data-Science-Using-Python
This repository contains all three projects of the course "Programming for Data Science using Python" 
## Introduction
This course gives basic idea of data analysis projects where where we will be doing some analysis using
SQL or Python and then visualization using python libraries.

For this course we have to submit three projects as follows:

### Project 1: Investigate Relational Database
#### Overview
In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. 
You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. 
As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

### Project 2: Analyse US Bikeshare Data
#### Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
 
### Project 3: Github Command Documentation
#### Overview
To put what you've learned about version control and GitHub into practice! In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git.
