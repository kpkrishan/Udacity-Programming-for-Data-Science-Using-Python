# Bikeshare Project

### Introduction
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
We will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender

Birth Year


### The Files
To answer the questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. 
To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. 
You will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv

new_york_city.csv

washington.csv
